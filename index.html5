One of my favorite ways to learn is through interactive apps, especially free ones, so I was excited to discover the SoloLearn app so I could develop my programming skills further. Here is my review of the free SoloLearn app for programming and coding in honor of Computer Science Education Week- read more about Computer Science Education Week and the Hour of Code here.
